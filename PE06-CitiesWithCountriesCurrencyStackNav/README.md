
This ia a basic React Native application that uses React Navigation to create a bottom tab navigation with four screens: "CitiesNAV," "AddCity," "CountriesNAV," and "AddCountry." And using a stack navigation for CitiesNAV  & CountriesNAV. Each screen is associated with a component and is configured with initial parameters.
Steps:
Creating instances of createBottomTabNavigator and createNativeStackNavigator using Tab and Stack variables, respectively.Defining a functional component CitiesStackScreen that represents the stack-based navigation for the Cities * countries section. It uses createNativeStackNavigator and configures the header style and color.Initializing the component state with empty cities and countries arrays.Defining functions addCity, addCountry, addLocation, and addCurrency to update the component state with new data.Wrapping the entire app with NavigationContainer to enable navigation functionality.Configuring the Tab.Navigator component, which represents the bottom tab navigation.
Configuring individual tab screens using Tab.Screen. 
Process:
This app works by defining the initial state with empty cities and countries arrays Inside the App component. There are two methods, addCity and addCountry, that update the state by adding a new city or country respectively. The render method returns the main structure of the app. It wraps the Tab.Navigator inside a NavigationContainer, which provides the navigation context for the app. Each Tab.Screen represents a screen in the bottom tab navigation. The name prop is the name of the screen, while the component prop specifies the component to render for that screen. The initialParams prop is used to pass initial parameters to the screen components. In this case, the cities and addCity parameters are passed to the "CitiesNav" and "AddCity" screens, while the countriesNav and addCountry parameters are passed to the "Countries" and "AddCountries" screens.
