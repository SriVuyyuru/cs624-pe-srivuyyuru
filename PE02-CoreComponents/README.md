The CoreComponents mobile app follows the input-process-output model, which is a fundamental approach used to design programs.

Input: How the user can enter their favorite MSCS course using an input field provided in the app. This input is then processed by the program to produce an output.

The Process heading explains how the program processes the user input and generates the output. The program retrieves information about the MSCS courses from the CityU Catalog website and displays them on the screen. The program uses the useState hook to manage the state of the favoriteCourse variable and updates it when the user enters a new value in the input field.

Output: Describes what the program displays on the screen. The program displays the 8 core MSCS courses, 2 depth of study courses, and 1 capstone course. Additionally, the program displays the user's favorite course, which is updated as the user enters a new value in the input field.
